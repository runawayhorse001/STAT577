This is the shared repository for STAT 577 class at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Wenqiang texted to Cheng and decided to creat this shared repository on
Dec.2, 2017 at Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

The main goal of this shared repository is to share how to use R, Rmarkdown and Github to do the statistics homework problems.

Please be aware, however, this should go without saying, but Iâ€™ll include it within this point, absolutely do not plagiarize.
